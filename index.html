		<p>I moved the zen CSS, to <a href='./css-zen'>here</a>.</p>
		<p>This will eventually be a communistic domain operated by me, <a mailto="cpaynetaffe@gmail.com">Connor Taffe</a> (<a href="github.com/cptaffe">@github</a>). I plan to delegate a 3rd level domain to each person, who can then delegate further subdomains to their personal servers. Other 3rd level domains of this domain may contain an ftp, torrent listing, etc.</p>
