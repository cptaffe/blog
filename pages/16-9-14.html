	<h3>Required Hours</h3>
	<p>
		As part of the EIT scholarships stipulations, students are required to spend 140 hours per semester in the EIT lab, basically 10 hours per week.
	</p>
	<h3>ETAS</h3>
	<p>
		Today I ventured into the ETAS building. Although it looked dilapidated on the exterior and the rusty "Sky Bridge" did not give a great impression, it was beautiful on the inside.
	</p><p>
		As you enter you find yourself in a hallway leading to a beautiful central plaza-like area surrounding a chasm that reaches from ground floor to the skylights above. Surrounding that are an array of comfortable chairs and couches as well as desks to accomodate students who would like a place to sit and work.
	</p><p>
		As I walked by a computer lab located in a somewhat hidden corner of the building, I saw that it included the same comfortable couches I had seen in the plaza, as well as a less open arrangement and more out of the way location.
	</p>
	<h3>ASMSA CSE 3</h3>
	<p>
		At ASMSA, a computer lab exists known as CSE 3, curated by one of my favorite teachers, Nicholas Seward, it served as the place I spent most of my time at ASMSA. It was somewhat out of the way where people who weren't compsci kids wouldn't really come, and the environment was one where one could do whatever they wanted outside the direct scrutiny of the administration.
	</p><p>
		On several occasions, all the computers in the lab would be commodeared by someone wanting to run a distrubuted program. We played loud music and spent many an evening working on computer science and physics. It was wonderful.
	</p><p>
		As much as this may sound like fond nostalgiatic rambling, I spent many a saturday and sunday afternoon on the 4th floor of the Old Hospital wing in CSE 3 working on homework or coding.
	</p>
	<h3>EIT Lab</h3>
	<p>
		At UALR, me and my friends have not found such an awesome lab. The EIT lab is quiet, there is no music, the administration walks through all day, and it is on the ground floor of EIT, readily viewable by anyone. It doesn't carry the same quality of creative action and fun that CSE 3 did. In fact, to speak to anyone, I basically have to wisper to make sure I don't bother other people in the lab. The EIT lab is one of the most uncomfortable places I've been.
	</p>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
		UALR doesn't have a place where computer science people can group and talk about coding problems in a fun environment. As a result, I basically haven't met any computer science people I can talk to about compiler writing, distributed programs, parallel stuff, random python/c errors, or whatever.
	</p><p>
		I feel that as a result, UALR is lacking the environment that ASMSA had, where people could learn from each other. I would recommend that another lab be avaliable for EIT hours, and that lab be located somewhere in ETAS, with a few comfortable couches and a less formal setting.
	</p><p>
		Ideally, one should be able to walk in, work on some code, play music, talk to whoever, and take a nap.
	</p><p>
		I know this sounds crazy, but UALR needs creative collaboration in a setting that people actually want to be.
