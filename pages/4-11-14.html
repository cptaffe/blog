		Our tour of the EAC involved exploring a couple of the rooms on the left side of the 4th floor of EIT, the area reserved for the EAC.
	</p>
	<h3>Overall</h3>
	<p>
		The tour was pretty awesome, since I work there most days, it was nothing new. But I did get the opportunity for Dr. Cruz to tell some awesome stories about her international trips to show off her CAVE technology.
	</p> <p>
		The EAC is a pretty great place to work, and Dr. Cruz's research is very interesting. This last weekend we (myself and my coworkers) got to configure and test the new Oculus Rifts we just got in. In general, the EAC is pretty cool, with new furniture, 3D tv's everywhere, the CAVE system (the most high-resolution I've ever seen).
