	<h3>Filtering images by color</h3>
	<p>
		Google search provides a feature at the bottom lefthand corner called search by color. Search by color provides a subset of the current search, in color. These colored searches can help you narrow in on the specific context of your query. For example, a fossil in black rock might be easily found by clicking the black paint chip.
	</p> <p>
		There is also a search similar images link at the bottom of each image, this can be useful if you find an image you want, and would like to see others of a similar type.
	</p> 
	<h3>How search works</h3>
	<p>
		When a search query is sent to google, it is compared against a huge database of indexed pages and using hundreds of comparisons to determine if the page is what you are searching for, and using page rank to determine the legitimacy of the page. 
	</p> <p>
		These indexes are gained using web crawling applications, software that follows links from page to page, indexing each page and noting qualities about it.
	</p>
	<h3>Keywords and word order</h3>
	<p>
		Queries to google should be as consice as possible. Extra english language words should be dumped. Word order is also important, for example "a who" and "the who" are two entirely different sets of results.
	</p>
	<h3>Finding text on a web page</h3>
	<p>
		All major browsers provide pattern matching by typing ctrl/cmd-f. This opens the find bar which you can use to enter terms you wish to find verbatim in the page.
	</p>
	<h3>Search suggests something new</h3>
	<p>
		Google provides suggestions in the form of spelling, suggestions as you type, and as you type search. These are extremely useful real time outputs that can give you guidance on how your query should be improved.
	</p>
	<h3>Different media and content</h3>
	<p>
		Google suggests the most useful media type when you search. If your query is often found in the images media type, google will provide you with a view of some images and a link to the images page. These media types are different types of content google provides. There are many diffent types, from images and video to patents and law with Google Scholar.
	</p>
	<h3>Search engine results page</h3>
	<p>
		The SERP can provide a plethora of knowledge on a topic. Google's search results page often provides a summary of content to the right. From this and the provided links you can determine whether google has found the correct results, and rethink your query if not
	</p>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
