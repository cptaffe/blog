	<p>
		My presentation for FYE was about a long term project I have been working on for around six months called lispy. Lispy is a basilisk (lisp-like language) interpreter written in python. You can find the presentation <a href="//byteflame.org/lispy">here</a>, with links to my website, the lispy github repo, etc.

	<h3>Overall</h3>
	<p>
		I enjoyed the presentation and it seemed I did well enough. Although I started off a little nervous, after Dylan insulted lispy's lack of infinite lists, I was alright. The interaction from him put everyone in a jolly mood and made me a lot more comfortable. After that I talked through the rest of the presentation well.

		I believe the good portions of my presentation were the slides, which were a custom hack on the slides used at Google IO, complete wit a lispy logo I decided to wip up in Inkscape. I believe the content was fairly good, and although it may have been a bit dry to an audience perhaps not too enthused with language design, was well taken. Aside from that, my presentation skill, as mentioned above, was less than perfect on account of nervousness, but nonetheless I thought I was not the worst. By far my favorite part was the breaking of the solemn tone with my arguments. Dylan and I planeed a pro-con presentation. Mine with lispy as a project and my success thus far, and Dylan's with lispy as a very unusable and mostly useless langauge. I thought this was hilarious.
