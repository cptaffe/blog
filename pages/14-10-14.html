	<h3></h3>
	<p>
		My presentation for FYE was about a long term project I have been working on for around six months called lispy. Lispy is a basilisk (lisp-like language) interpreter written in python. You can find the github repo, wiki, said presentation, etc. <a href="//byteflame.org/lispy">here</a>.

	<h3>Overall</h3>
	<p>
		I enjoyed the presentation and it seemed I did well enough.
