	<h3>Operators</h3>
	<p>
		Google search provides the use of in-query operators, extra text added to a search text to augment the search text. These can most easily be expressed when we think of the queries search results as a set of results. Each element of the set is a link, and these can be augmented by the union or exclusion of sets of results.
	</p>
	<h3>Specific Operators</h3>
	<p>
		Google offers the site: operator, where one can get the subset of results that reside on a particular web page or set of web pages. For example site:stanford.edu would return a set of results where the page is all under the url stanford.edu.
	</p> <p>
		Another operator is intext:, intext lets one get the subset of results with a word in the text. For example, searching a topic with a key concept using intext: would return all the pages expressing that concept.
	</p> <p>
		Quotes are also useful. Imagine you are searching for a song lyric, you might search the lyrics in plain text, but that will return the most valid pages with those terms, usually with little regard for order. If you use the "" (quote) operator, you will get the set of pages where that phrase is found word-for-word in a string.
	</p> <p>
		This quote operator also allows for the OR operator. The OR operator (capital "or") allows for the set of results with either quoted phrase, basically unioning the two sets.
