	<h3>Intro</h3>
	<p>
		For Data Structures & Algorithms, I had an assignment dealing with generating prime numbers below an input value. This was to be done with a dynamically resizable medium, so I chose a linked list.
	</p><p>
		There are two ways to do operations on linked lists, iteratively and recursively. For example, you can iterate over a linked list similar to the way you would an array, or you can recursively self-call with the next linked item and do the same.
	</p> 
	<h3>Recursion Issues</h3>
	<p>
		Being awesome and whatnot, I chose recursion, using the Atkin Seive to generate primes. At first I used a really junky non-optimized prime generator, but the Atkin Sieve is so much faster. For instance, a 6 million and below prime generation takes several seconds in the super-naive version, and is almost instant with the Atkin Seive.
	</p> <p>
		Back to recursion. My implementation was working perfectly until I entered 6 million only to be hit with a segfault. It took me a while to come to the conclusion that it was not my code, but perhaps too many stack frames.
	</p>
	<h3>Solution with Tail Recursion Optimization</h3>
	<p>
		To test this, I compiled my program with -O3 (which recognizes tail recursion and modifies it to iterative form) and tried 6 million. It worked.
	</p> <p>
		The problem is really cuased because in Linux programs have a static stack size allocated at runtime, but since my program was creating a stack of 60 million frames (to overflow the -O3 version), it ran out of memory.
	</p>
	<h3>Solution</h3>
	<p>
		I solved this issue by rewriting my recursive print in iterative form, which clang apparently did not optimize although it was in tail-call form.
