	<h3>Presentation Style</h3>
	<p>
		Although I agree with many of Thomas Friedman's points, his presentation style is awful. The video was basically forty minutes of buzzwords, repitition of said buzzwords, and bad metaphors, there were at least ten repitions of "vertical to horizontal", and numerous words like "productivity" strewn about.
	</p>
	<h3>The World is Flat, versions</h3>
	<p>
		Other than an overall boring presentation, his points were valid and his concluding statements were well done.
	</p> <p>
		In this talk, Friedman talks about what he categorizes as the three stages of "The World is Flat". What he calls "The World is Flat 1.0" is the Columbian expansion period where countries expanded to the Americas, this period also includes British expansion to Africa and India, etc. "The World is Flat 2.0" is the following period, ending in the year two thousand, when companies, not countries, were the vector in globalization. "The World is Flat 3.0" is the period from 2000 to the present, when the internet provided a vector for individuals to globalize.
	</p> <p>
		Saying that the columbian period was spear-headed by contry-based globalization is a bit incorrect. For instance, although countries played more of a part, companies and individuals (although only wealthy) were the main factor in the spread of people to the New World. De Soto, for instance, led an exploration of the Americas and financed it himself. The Virginia Company of London financed Jamestown, not the government of Britain.
	</p> <p>
		It is understandable, as countries did provide more of a boundary than they do today, but the country had little to do with the push to globalize. International trade routes through Africa to Asia had been established long before the Americas were discovered. In America, the resulting tobacco trade was headed by individual plantation owners, not large corporations or countries.
	</p> <p>
		Aside from this, he also misses that since the dawn of modern humans, individual and group trade has persisted without need for a government of any size.
	</p> <p>
		In conclusion, I disagree with his version-based categorization of the world.
	</p>
	<h3>The World is Flat, 3.0</h3>
	<p>
		The World is Flat 3.0 refers to the changes brought along recently by the .com bubble, resulting overinvestement in fiber optic cable and resulting wiring of the world.
	</p> <p>
		I think this is somewhat incorrect. In America, at least, service is still very slow. Little Rock, for instance, does not have a fiber network, some twenty years after the initial boom. Many ISPs now block port 80 inbound, or perhaps all ports, creating a top-down consumption driven environment from what could have, and somewhat is, a leveled playing field.
	</p> <p>
		Even worse, there is the rising power of companies like Comcast and Time Warner, which wish to merge and become the largest ISP by a huge margin. Comcast has already shown what Friedman talks about as "Whatever can be done, will be done", in this case being the throttling of services unless some type of data tarriff is payed.
	</p> <p>
		Foundataions like Fight for the Future are combatting this type of undermining of the main idea behind the internet. The internet (TCP/IP) is supposed to be a decentralized network where every node can broadcast and recieve information. The internet (HTML over TCP, integration of DNS) has made the public dependant on a large, interconnected network, and a central DNS server.
	</p> <p>
		These developments have proved unfortunate. ICANN, the company in charge of DNS has proven its dedication to profit with many ridiculous and quite useless TLD (top level domains), and ridiculous requirements for their resale.
	</p> <p>
		My personal opinion is that the internet at large, that being the ISP controlled interconnected network should become a FCC utility, such as phone lines. That is the solution that solved the monoplies of companies like Bell Telephone, and it will most likely solve the current problems with companies like Comcast.
	</p>
	<h3>The Green Revolution</h3>
	<p>
		Thomas Friedman states "How can there be a resolution with no casualties", as he talks about the current state of the "Green Revolution". He talks about how Cities in China and Dubai are creating huge cities with green ideas. He basically lays out that Green shouldn't be looked at the way 1950s industrialists lookes at 1970s hippies. Green is a way to preserve the environment we live in, it should be the NASA of the cold war era, a hugely supported idea that held a country together towards a goal. NASA, and the related research done during the cold war era, pushed the frontiers of technology in a way that was not supported by the current economy, and succeeded in creating some of the technology that sparked the creation of our current technology boom.
	</p> <p>
		The technology revolution, as Freidman states, was a "change or die" revolution, one that killed off many of the largest firms of the time. Friedman wants to rebrand green, and push America to become one of the countries on the frontier of what he hopes will become an actual revolution.
	</p> <p>
		Will "green" become an actual revolution, probably not. Green makes no money, thusly, as it currently stands, will never happend in the same rapid way that the technology revolution did. It will have to be prodded on by regulation, which will be a much more difficult road.
