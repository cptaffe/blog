		Plan 9. Plan 9 is an OS developed by Bell Labs back in 1992, and its main() code is like that. Along with the void declaration, Plan 9 made some other changes which I like.

		For example, it moved all of the system libraries into one file, libc.h. The function print() now replaces printf(), open() no longer create()s files.
